# MS SQL Server Trail
### This is a collection of all learnings that I have acquired & builds up on my existing knowledge of SQL
* The intent was to get familiar with the Microsoft's SQL Server Management environment while revising SQL concepts.
* In further update to this repo, I'll be adding learnings on SSMS & SSRS as well.
* The course I followed is [SQL for Data Analysis - with SQL Server](https://www.udemy.com/course/sql-basics-crash-course-with-sql-server/) by Travis Cuzick.
* The [AdventureWorks database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms) was used as per the course requirement.
